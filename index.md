# About Me
Here is **Xianzhu Shao**.

I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in <font color='#87CEEB'>Mathematics and Applied Mathematics</font> from the College of Science at Tianjin University of Commerce in June 2023. After graduation, I worked as an <font color='#87CEEB'>AI algorithm engineer at Mutlisim Technology Co.</font> from 2023 to 2024, where I was responsible for developing <font color='#87CEEB'>AI algorithms, optimization algorithms, and high-performance computing solutions</font>. Currently, I am part of a joint algorithm development team at <font color='#87CEEB'>Tencent & Canway</font>, focusing on developing deep learning algorithms for <font color='#87CEEB'>AIOps</font> (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations).
